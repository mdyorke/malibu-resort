  <li>Cookies: This Website uses "cookies". By using this Website and agreeing to this Notice, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this Notice. Cookies are small text files that this Website sends to your computer for record-keeping
    purposes and this information is stored in a file on your computer's hard drive. Cookies make web surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use these to improve your next visit to this Website.</li>
  <li>One of the purposes of cookies is to simplify the use of the Website. A cookie may save a user's login details for example, so that the user does not need to login every time. Cookies, by themselves, do not provide us with your personal information.</li>
  <li>Cookies may be either "persistent" or "temporary" (or "session") cookies. A persistent cookie retains user preferences for a particular Website allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions and remains valid until its set expiry
    date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date). A temporary cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</li>
  <li>Cookies are also used for statistical or marketing purposes, to determine how the Website is used. These cookies are provided by us as well as by third parties (e.g., advertising partners). While we do not control or have access to the advertiser cookies
    we do permit those cookies to be used on this Website to facilitate tailored advertising and to monitor patterns of buying specific goods or interest in - for example, holidays or hobbies. These cookies run advertisements tailored to the user based
    on his online buying habits.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>For a current list of the advertising partners who use cookies on this Website, and to modify your cookies settings, please access our Cookie Consent Tool. Additionally, your browser may be set to allow you to be notified when a cookie is to be placed
    on your browser, decline the cookie, or delete cookies that have been placed on your browser. Some functions of our Web sites may not work or may work slowly if a cookie is refused.</li>
  <li>From Other Sources: We may receive your personal information from other sources, such as public databases; joint marketing partners; social media platforms; from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, as well
    as from other third parties. For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your Website account, certain personal information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include personal information that is
    part of your profile or your friends' profiles.</li>
  <li>Mobile Devices: When you use access our Services from a mobile device, we may collect information such as your unique device ID and your location information. When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App
    usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Do We Use Your Information?</h3>

  <li>To personalize your experience on the Services by presenting products and offers tailored to you.</li>
  <li>To allow you to participate in sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions and to administer these activities. Some of these activities have additional rules, which could contain additional information about how we use and disclose your Personal Information,
    so we suggest that you read these rules carefully.</li>
  <li>To facilitate social sharing functionality.</li>
  <li>To allow you to send messages to a friend through the Services. By using this functionality, you are telling us that you are entitled to use and provide us with your friend's name and email address.</li>
  <li>For our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new products, enhancing, improving or modifying our Services, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns
    and operating and expanding our business activities.</li>
  <li>As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government

  <li>We may also aggregate and/or anonymize personal information for research, to improve our products and services; and for other business purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Do We Disclose Your Information?</h3>
<p><strong>Your information may be disclosed as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Vendors and Service Providers: We may disclose your information to vendors and service providers retained by us in connection with our business such as: travel services companies, financial services companies, property owners' associations, vacation
    insurance companies, website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, credit card processing, tax and financial advisers, legal advisers,
    accountants or auditing services.</li>
  <li>Message Boards: We may make message boards, blogs, and other such user-generated content facilities available to users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should always be careful when deciding to disclose
    your personal information. We are not responsible for privacy practices of other users including website operators to whom you provide information.</li>
  <li>Disclosure Permitted by Law: Law enforcement authorities, government or public agencies, regulators, and/or to any other person having appropriate legal authority or justification for receipt of your information, if we believe that we are required or
    permitted to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Wyndham or others.</li>
  <li>Anonymized/Aggregated Information: Because aggregated or anonymized information does not personally identify you, we may use it for any purpose. If we combine anonymized or aggregated data with personal information, we will treat the combined information
    as personal information according to this Privacy Notice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Do We Safeguard Your Information?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Security of Your Information: We will take reasonable steps to protect the information you provide us from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial
    procedures to help safeguard and secure your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. Unfortunately, no security system is 100% secure, thus we cannot ensure the security of information that you
    provide to us via the Services.</li>
  <li>Other Important Information</li>
  <li>Information Provided on Someone Else's Behalf: If you provide us with information about someone else, please ensure you have the person's permission to do so for the purposes detailed in this Privacy Notice.</li>
  <li>Links to Websites: The Services may have links to other websites that are not operated by us and therefore, we have no control over how these websites may collect your information. You should read the privacy notices on those other websites before you
    submit your information through them.</li>
  <li>Social Media Sites: Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM or any other
    app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Apps
    or our Social Media Pages.</li>
  <li>Changes to Our Privacy Notice: From time to time we may revise this Notice and/or use personal information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this Notice to meet changes in the regulatory or business environment, or to satisfy the
    needs of our customers and service providers. Updated and date stamped versions will be posted on the Services.</li>
  <li>Minors: We do not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from children under 18 years of age, and no part of Services is directed to individuals under the age of 18.</li>
